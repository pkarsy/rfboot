# rfboot

# Importand note : As time passes, the limitations of this software become more and more apparent. Only atmega328+cc1101+makefile(no platformio). If you are interested on OTA programming consider using other solutions like the excellent [esp-link](https://github.com/jeelabs/esp-link)


Atmega328p Bootloader for wireless (OTA) code uploads, using the CC1101 RF chip.


Rfboot is very reliable. I use it for all my projects, even those without any need for RF connectivity, because I can work with dozens of projects in parallel without any need to swap serial cables. There are very few failed uploads (less than 1% in my tests), and fixed immediately with a second upload.</br>
Special care is taken (while rfboot is evolving) that all older rfboot installations are compatible with the newest uploading tool.</br>

Included :

- The actual atmega328 bootloader, intended to be installed to this MCU via an ISP programmer.
- A suitable utility (rftool) to easily create new projects (the directory structure) using rfboot as bootloader.
The same tool is used for code upload. Every project is created with unique RF settings and a
preconfigured Makefile. While developing, a "make send" uploads the code wirelessly.
- Instructions to assemble a **usb2rf module**, witch allows us to upload code to the target and,
**equally important**, to use a Serial Terminal (like gtkterm) to send and receive text,
analogous to Serial.print()  and Serial.read().

This project's emphasis is on reliability, security and usability.
